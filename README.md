Project analyzing discrimination

Discrimination in law enforcement, especially in the US, has been a prominent topic of conversation for decades. People argue that POC are more likely to be detained by the police, they are more likely to be arrested, and that their bails are set higher when compared to other white criminals. Our goal is to explore issues of race and ethnicity in law enforcement by analyzing crime reports from numerous states in America. Based on the data, we will  draw conclusions based on patterns in charges and their correlation to race.
